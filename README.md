# Simply Optimized
A very light base Fabric modpack to heavily optimize the game without any QoL improvements.

The Simply Optimized modpack intends to be the very base of mods/configurations for performance. You can add any mods on top of it at your own taste. It only contains essential and lesser known rendering optimization mods and a few mods to speed up other things like usually slow loading times. For each new release, I try to bring the performance up and the mod count down, picking out the best solutions possible.

*for some reason, every second optimization modpack implies this, but when i look at the mods i see a lot of QoL that is not related to optimization at all-*

One of its purposes may be to be recommended to people new to Fabric who just want a selection of mods for the top performance without much else - instead of listing the mods manually, you can just link them here!
