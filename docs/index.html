            <p>The Simply Optimized modpack aims to provide a <u>base of the best optimization mods available, configured for the maximum performance achievable</u>. Thanks to countless hours of research, it often outperforms other optimization solutions in benchmarks, and when it doesn't, I investigate why to improve it further.</p>
            <p>SO is built with maintainability and simplicity in mind. This means that <u>little to no quality-of-life or visual enhancements are included in the pack</u> by default - you are expected to add any additional mods you want yourself (if that causes issues, feel free to ask for support in our <a href="https://discord.gg/WSQdQZUjeR">Discord server</a> and we'll try to help out).</p>
            <p>This also means it can update to new Minecraft versions in a matter of hours or minutes and sometimes has versions for snapshots! Additionally, it's quick to recieve mod updates with new cutting-edge performance improvements. I strive to keep the pack as relevant as it can be at any given moment.</p>
