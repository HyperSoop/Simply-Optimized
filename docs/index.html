            <p>The Simply Optimized modpack aims to provide the best optimization mods available, configured for the maximum performance achievable. Thanks to countless hours of research, it often outperforms other optimization solutions in benchmarks, and anywhere it doesn't is where there's something exciting to learn.</p>
            <p>SO is built with simplicity and maintainability in mind. This means it can update to new Minecraft versions in a matter of hours or minutes and sometimes has versions for snapshots! It's also quick to recieve mod updates with new cutting-edge performance improvements. I strive to keep the pack as relevant as it can be at any given moment.</p>
            <p>Little to no quality-of-life or visual enhancements are included in the pack by default - you are expected to add any additional mods you want yourself, and in case that causes issues, feel free to ask for support in our Discord server and we'll try to help out.</p>
