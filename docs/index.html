            <p>A very light base Fabric modpack to heavily optimize the game without any QoL improvements.</p>
        </header>
        <section>
            <p>The Simply Optimized modpack intends to be the very base of mods/configurations for performance. You can add any mods on top of it at your own taste. It only contains optimization mods, increasing your FPS, reducing slutters or speeding up loads, with countless tweaks to get the most out of them. For each new release, I try to bring the performance up, picking the best solutions possible.</p>
            <p>for some reason, every second optimization modpack implies this, but when i look at the mods i see a lot of QoL that is not related to optimization at all-</p>
            <p>One of its purposes may be to be recommended to people new to Fabric who just want a selection of mods for the best performance without much else - instead of listing the mods manually, you can just link them here!</p>
            <p>I can confidently claim this is the best optimization modpack in terms of performance as of now.</p>
            <p><i>Also works on Quilt without issue! just replace Fabric API with QSL and you're good to go!</i></p>
