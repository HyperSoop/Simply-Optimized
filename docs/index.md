The Simply Optimized modpack intends to be the very base of mods/configurations for performance. You can add any mods on top of it at your own taste. It only contains essential and lesser known rendering optimization mods and a few mods to speed up other things like usually slow loading times. For each new release, I try to bring the performance up and the mod count down, picking out the best solutions possible.

*for some reason, every second optimization modpack implies this, but when i look at the mods i see a lot of QoL that is not related to optimization at all-*

One of its purposes may be to be recommended to people new to Fabric who just want a selection of mods for the top performance without much else - instead of listing the mods manually, you can just link them here!

I can confidently claim this is the best optimization modpack in terms of performance as of now.

Works on Quilt without issue! just replace Fabric API with QSL and you're good to go!
